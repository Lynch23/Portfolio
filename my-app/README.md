# (React Movie App) [https://lucky-creponne-6f1bff.netlify.app/]
## Description
This is an interface for a web-app built on react. It allows the user to search for movies from a database and displays the movie title, description, actors and other information about the movie.
## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React
- React Router
- Styled-Components
In this project, I used HTML for markup inside React functional components. For the styles, I used CSS styled-components and a few templates made from pure CSS. For basic error handling while fetching data to our endpoints, I wrapped the fetch API call inside async functions. It is being hosted on netlify.
